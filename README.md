easy_php_dev
============

This script sets up a PHP/Apache development environment on OSX.

Benefits
--------

In Your home directory a `DevSites` folder will be created. Inside of there you simply create a folder for each of the sites you want to work on, ending with a with a .dev domain (mysite.dev, or mysite.com.dev), and it becomes your document root. If you navigate to it in a browser on your local machine (http://mysite.dev) it will be immediately available.
